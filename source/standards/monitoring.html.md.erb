At GDS, we follow the Service Manual guidance on how to [monitor the status of services][] and set [performance metrics][]. 

We recommend using [Pingdom][] to monitor your serviceâ€™s availability. To further ensure your service is working, you should:

* run regular [smoke tests][] using a browser automation app such as Selenium
* implement a tool to ensure user journeys are working as you expect
* monitor applications for errors using an error tracking app such as [Sentry][]
* implement configuration management to set up repeatable monitoring

Collecting metrics on the performance of your service is useful for [capacity planning][] and autoscaling. You should:

* apply metrics-based monitoring because it's not platform-specific
* create dashboards using [Grafana][] to view metrics from your datasource, for example related to your infrastructure or application

Reliability Engineering is running a beta on using [Prometheus][] as the operational metrics service for GDS. It will be available to all teams that use the [recommended hosting][] options. Please see the [reliability engineering docs][] to find out more.
